# NC-Ecosystem-indicators

The purpose of this repository is to upload and organize data for the NC Collaboratory project. 

In this repository, there are folders named "data", "figures", "output", and "scripts."

If you have data to upload, please click on the "data" folder to open it, then "Add file" on the top right hand side. Then, select "Upload files" from the drop down and select your files. In the "Commit changes" box, please write a short description of the files you're uploading, then click the green "Commit changes" button. (Make sure you have used the naming conventions and filled out the metadata form)

Github does not allow you to upload files larger than 25 MB via browser, so if you have a file under 100 MB and want to upload it, please use the command line ([Instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository#adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line))
