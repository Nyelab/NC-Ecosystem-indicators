,"For both of these data sets, it may be important for your purposes to consider the difference between anÊissuedÊlicense and a license actively used in fishing. People hold onto licenses that they donÕt actually use for a variety of reasons. If you are going to look at effort or anything having to do with the number of participants involved in commercial fishing in North Carolina, itÕs important to keep that in mind. If you get to a point in your analyses where you need active participant data, IÕll be happy to run that for you.Ê"
