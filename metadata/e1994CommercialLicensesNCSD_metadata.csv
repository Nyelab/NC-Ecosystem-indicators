,"For both of these data sets, it may be important for your purposes to consider the difference between anÊissuedÊlicense and a license actively used in fishing. People hold onto licenses that they donÕt actually use for a variety of reasons. If you are going to look at effort or anything having to do with the number of participants involved in commercial fishing in North Carolina, itÕs important to keep that in mind. If you get to a point in your analyses where you need active participant data, IÕll be happy to run that for you.Ê"
Once again, our best dataset starts in 1994 when we started the Trip Ticket Program and began collecting more detailed commercial fishing license data. Currently, we only have access to commercial fishing license data back to 1994. The Endorsement to Sell (ETS) license was the main license for commercial fishermen through 1999/2000. At that time, we switched over to the Standard Commercial Fishing License (SCFL) system that we have now. For dealer licenses, our currently dealer license data also begins in 1994. I’ve shared a spreadsheet with Rich and Janet Nye that contains all of the relevant commercial fishing, vessel, and dealer licenses issued each year back to 1994. The license type acronyms are explained below."
