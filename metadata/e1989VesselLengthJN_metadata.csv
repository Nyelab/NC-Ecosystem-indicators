Comments:,"This is the older vessel data, broken out by the same length categories. Our commercial vessel licensing system was different prior to 2000. We didn’t have the same Commercial Fishing Vessel Registration license that we do now, but registrants had to indicate the intended purpose of the vessel as commercial, private, etc., so I only selected for the self-identified commercial vessels."
