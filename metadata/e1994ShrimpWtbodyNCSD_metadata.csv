Comments:,Some landings hidden due to confidentiality
,Rows that are confidential have blanks in Pounds column and CONF column has asterik
,"In three of the confidential situations, only one row for a particular year/species combination was confidential, so I had to roll those landings into another waterbody because you could theoretically use the annual landings I’ve already given you to interpolate the hidden confidential data."
,"The first instance was 1995 – Lockwood’s Folly – Shrimp, Uncl. I rolled these landings into 1995 – Shallotte River, so you’ll see that row is labeled Shallotte River and Lockwood’s Folly. I only added the pounds from 1995 Lockwood’s Folly, not the dealers, trips, participants, vessels, or licenses because that could lead to a duplicate count."
,"In the other two instances, 2010-Shallotte River-Shrimp,Brown and 2003-Shallotte River-Shrimp,White were the only confidential rows for that species for that year, so I added those landings to Inland Waterway (Brunswick), but not the participants, so you’ll see that row shows the combined waterbodies as the waterbody name. For each waterbody, the participant/trip counts are accurate, but in these cases, the pounds for those waterbodies were summed as indicated."
