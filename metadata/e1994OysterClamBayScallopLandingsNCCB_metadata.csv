Comments:,"Oyster, clam, and bay scallop data by"
,"private (leased) vs. public bottom type, and I included the number of leases as a summary statistic. As a"
,"caveat, the number of leases has a small amount of error. Sometimes we are missing a lease number in"
,"our data, and sometimes the same lease number may be entered in a slightly different format which"
,"could lead to double counting (e.g., lease 123-b could also be entered as 123 B, which would be counted"
,"as 2 leases in this program). Generally those things are caught in our edits, but it’s hard to account for"
,"everything in the lease data. For Bay Scallops, many of the private landings were confidential, so then I"
,had to make private and public both confidential since I had given you the total annual landings in the
,Commercial Landings 94-21 dataset which would have made it possible to back calculate the
,confidential private landings.
