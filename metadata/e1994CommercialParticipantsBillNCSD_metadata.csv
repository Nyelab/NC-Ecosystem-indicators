Comments:,This is a dataset of our major commercial fisheries with participant
,"data. A few species are grouped (tuna, triggerfishes, porgies, etc.) to help aggregate things enough to"
,"not have issues with confidentiality. I think thread herring, scup, and bay scallop are the only species"
,"included in this list that are confidential for some years. You’ll see an asterisk in the CONF column, and"
,the landings and value data are removed. If you don’t see a specific species broken out individually that
,"you want to see, feel free to ask and I can pull it out for you. This dataset also includes participant data."
,"The numbers of dealers, trips and vessels are pretty self-explanatory, but I wanted to clarify Participants"
,"vs. Licenses. In our database, a single participant can hold multiple licenses. The participant is identified"
,"by a participant ID number, and the participant count in this dataset is a count of the number of distinct"
,"participant IDs in the data for each row. Licenses is a count of the commercial licenses used, which will"
,"generally be greater than the number of participants. For example, one participant may hold 3"
,"commercial licenses. That individual may fish with one of the licenses, and then assign out the other 2"
,"licenses, but only the license owner would be included in the participant count. We generally use"
,participant count rather than license count when reporting our data because it’s a little more
,"straightforward, but it does underestimate the number of people fishing. Conversely, the license count"
,"may overestimate the number of people fishing. As an example, you might have a fisherman sell at 2"
,"dealers. If the fisherman holds 2 licenses, the two dealers might incorrectly put two different license"
,numbers instead of just the one that the fisherman is actively using because they had the other number
,saved in their system. Feel free to ask if you have questions; I don’t mean to make things too
,"complicated, but it’s helpful to explain the data."
