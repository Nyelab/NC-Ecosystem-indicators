Variables Generated in Dataset:,"Estimated number of brown, pink, and white shrimp in Pamlico Sound"
Timeframe of Dataset:,1987-2019
"Data Collection Period (e.g., June and September)",June and September
Geographic Study Area:,Pamlico Sound Mainbody (>2 m)
Does dataset include informaton governed under IRB or HIPAA?,No
Comments:,"Estimates are derived from spatial GAMs that use CPUE data from P195, white shrimp only have estimates for Fall (September) because they are infrequently caught in P195 in the summer survey"
