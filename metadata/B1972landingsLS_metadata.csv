Variables Generated in Dataset:,4 R datasets within R datafile: 'trunc_df' is a truncated dataset (1981-2021) truncated to a time series where missing data is minimized. In this dataset landings in kilograms are standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Despite the dataset being truncated there are still a few missing values for fishery closures and those missing values are replaced with zeros. 'df_truncraw' is the truncated dataset (1981-2021) with landings in kilograms. Despite the dataset being truncated there are still a few missing values for fishery closures and those missing values are replaced with zeros. 'full_df' is the landings data over the full time series (1972-2021) with landings standardized as described above. Missing data was replaced with the mean for each species before standardization. 'df_fullraw' is the full dataset (1972-2021) with landings in kilograms. Missing data was replaced with the mean for each species.
